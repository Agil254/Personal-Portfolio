Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio!

Hi, I'm Agil, and this is my very first personal portfolio project! After spending years in the hospitality industry, I'm diving into web development and full-stack programming. 
This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a developer, showcasing my skills, projects, and growth as I explore the world of coding.

In this repository, you'll find the source code for my portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

My goal with this project was to create a clean and simple design that highlights my skills and work, while also being fully responsive. 
As I learn more technologies, I'll continue to enhance and update this portfolio.

This is just the beginning of my development journey, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building and learning. Check out the project, and feel free to leave feedback or connect with me for collaboration!
